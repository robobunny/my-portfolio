title: "About Me"
---
I am a self-taught full-stack JavaScript software developer. I want to help computers help people. In the last year I have leveraged my philosophy background, my interest in computers, and my capacity to self-motivate and learn quickly in order to learn coding. I am excited to continue learning and honing my skills through turning this hobby into a career.

## Coding Interests

My dream is to help build a more efficient, effective and equitable education system and I believe coding is an integral tool for that mission.

## Education

I taught myself to code using online tutorials, especially Andrew Mead's classes on Udemy. Through these hands-on tutorials, I've put together a few apps to hone the skills that I've learned. Self-teaching while working a full-time job has given me good practice in self-motivating and the discipline needed to achieve success as a developer.

I have a Master's degree in philosophy and I find that my background in philosophy has given me a strong foundation in logic and the conceptualization of abstractions. My studies in Latin and Greek as well as speaking fluent Spanish and German have also given me a groundwork for learning syntax and semantics quickly and understanding them thoroughly and intuitively.
