This post was etched into the fabric of the universe approximately 6 billion years ago, when the earth was formed out of stardust and the destiny of its author was extruded through space-time. 

Of course, Immanuel Kant would tell you that both space and time are the _a priori_ forms of our sense perceptions, which is to say that they come from our senses and not from things themselves. Most people who have read the _Kritik der reinen Vernunft_ find Immanuel Kant to be an insufferable pedant and (likely) wrong about this and other things.

## Why I wrote this blog post

I mostly just wanted to write down some random crap in the _markdown_ format so that I can configure this blog thingy and get off the ground. And now for a haiku:

react and markdown  
functions interpreting strings  
living zeros, ones
