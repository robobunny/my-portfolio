I have taught myself to code using courses and tutorials on Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, and manifold other places both online and in person. I'm amazed by and grateful for the people that have helped me along the way.

But my favorite way to learn is to come up with a problem and just try to solve it. Or to come up with a project and try to build it. There's always lots of googling and poring over the docs, but at the end I always come out knowing something new.
