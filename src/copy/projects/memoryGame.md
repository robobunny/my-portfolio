I undertook this project to learn test-driven development (TDD) _the extreme way_. Anyone can build a React App using a dev server. My goal is to use only a testing suite ([Jest](https://www.jestjs.io) with [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)) to ensure my app works **_without ever opening it in the browser_**. 

You can read more about this project and see code snippets on [my blog](/blog).

Once the game is built and deployed, you'll find a link to it here, as well as **in your heart**.

I have yet to devise a high-stakes way to see if I've succeeded or failed in this endeavor (I've likely failed). If you've got any exciting ideas you can [shoot me an email](/contact)! 

p.s. Did I mention the game features the lineup of the _1995 Cleveland Indians_? Fun fact: as a child, I wanted to be [Omar Vizquel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Vizquel).
