This is the first app I ever made using React. It's a simple "Magic-8-Ball" style app that lets you fill in custom responses, ask a question, and get a randomized answer. It's pretty useless but it shows off a couple skills I've learned!

## What I learned:

* React
  * Hooks
    * useState
    * useEffect
* React plugins
  * React router
  * React modal

## What I could improve

* Testing (check out my [Memory Game](/projects/memory-game) project where I learned about testing the hard way!)
* Ability to drag-and-drop to reorder elements
  * This is a useful feature in any list view UI
* Clean coding principles
  * e.g. "a function should only do one thing"
  * better semantic naming of functions and variable would increase readability and maintainability if this were production code
