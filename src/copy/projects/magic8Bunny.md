This is the first app I ever made using React. It's a simple "Magic-8-Ball" style app that lets you fill in custom responses, ask a question, and get a randomized answer. It's pretty useless but it shows off a couple skills I've learned!

## What I learned

- React: Hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()`
- React plugins like React router and React modal

## What I could improve

### Testing 

I didn't write any tests for this! I should go back and add some. Top see my testing skills in action, check out my [Memory Game](/projects/memory-game) project where I learned about testing the hard way!

### UI Improvements

The ability to drag-and-drop to reorder elements in the list of Magic 8 Bunny's responses would be a really useful feature and would be good practice to learn, since this is a useful feature in any list view UI that actually has a function.

### Clean coding principles

I wrote this app before I knew much about the principles of clean coding, e.g. "a function should only do one thing." Better semantic naming of functions and variable would increase readability and maintainability if this were production code.
