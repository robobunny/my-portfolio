This is a simple weather app. It encodes the location and returns the weather for that location.

## What I learned

* Node.js
* Express.js
	* building a REST API to be consumed by a React frontend
	* fetching and destructuring JSON data through REST APIs
* Heroku
	* getting the ports and proxies right

## What I could improve

* Input data validation: there is some error handling but vague inputs could easily lead to incorrect outputs.
* Clean code: better semantics and code splitting would increase maintainability


This project taught me a lot about building an API and how clients and servers communicate. I can't wait to get into something a bit more advanced!
